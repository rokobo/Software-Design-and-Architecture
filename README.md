# Software design and architecture specialization

This specialization is divided into 4 courses. It teaches how to think like a system architect for creating high quality software using design patterns, principles and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems.

## Object-oriented design

This part focuses on object-oriented analysis and design. Principles and guidelines of software design were expressed in UML and analised from given programs. The 4 parts of this course used the given `SharingApp` Java program to do the following:

1. Draw a class diagram:
